I do think that, as a professional musician myself, I like it when I get atleast a little bit of constructive acknowledgement from an audience. It lets me know they are participating and engaged. For this reason I think that there should be video prompts - likely dynamically displayed when the audience gets too loud\u00d6requestion more quite. Also, Benjamin seems very frustrated with the level of audience noise but did not say anything. I think he shoudl definately request that people tone it down during the less media driven/ambient parts of the performances. He actually thanked us when we (me especially,,,) let out a big SHHHHH\u00d6I think that he shoudl instruct the audience about what their decorum would ideally desired to be and I think that intro video media should also. Other than this the musicians were excellent, the music was very interesting and the mixd metaphores moving between the amient and electronica to symphonic moments were especially intruiging and I thought well done.

I needed a distraction after having a very bad week emotional week. The first Pulse event I attended was so amazing that I was looking forward to it. Me and my friend who went the first time last night could not believe how rude your staff was directing us in wrong directions and giving us rude comments along the way. The bartender poured the drinks all over. The man who gave out the free drink cards totally ignored me and I was one of the FIRST ones there. I was put in different lines to get in THREE times after already having a bracelet. The club music theme was not in there at ALL. It was purely symphony not like I mentioned the first Pulse where people were dancing. We were BORED and annoyed and waiting for it to get better. After the first number we thought it was odd that the symphony just stood up unexpectantly and LEFT the theatre. I could go on and on about how horrible this experience was. I am glad that I received this survey because I was going to  call today to express my utter disappointment. Also not to mention how drunk and obnoxious the crowd was. When we left EARLY by the way again your staff yelled at us as we were exiting to go a different way. When I go to the theatre and symphony which I have been doing so for YEARS I expect RESPECT AND ATTENTION as a patron. I will never attend another Pulse event again until somebody gets this place in order. Pretty bad as a local that I will not recommend anyone to go either. Based on the previous Pulse show the quality of even the people that attended were in POOR taste. No class at all...","tags":[]}

It is so refreshing to see so many young people clamoring to get in.  It offers a totally new and compelling format for classical concerts that, for all practical purposes, hasn't changed since the 17th century.  Every major orchestra should consider doing something like this because I'm convinced that it would generate a whole new audience.  However, it's important to present something that goes  beyond the mundane of what they experience in the clubs, that raises the bar of the musical experience, and last night's program did not do that.

I was however, disappointed with the type of electronic music played.  It sounded very muddled and lacked any vocals or emotion.I would have liked to hear a slow build up followed by an intense break down. Overall, the electronic music played had a minimal style that did not really make me (or any of my guests) want to dance.

Even though the instruments were amplified, there was a constant din of crowd chatter that could still be clearly heard even while the entire symphony was playing. These guys and gals deserve attention and are not simply background music for conversation. Maybe NWS could project a message on the walls asking for \"quiet moments\" when the entire symphony is playing. Chattering could resume during the electronic music and maybe even soloist songs. Easy to say, but probably difficult to achieve in reality. No fuddy duddy here. These comments are from a dedicated rock & roller who spends pleanty of time being blasted by classic rock, as close to the front of the stage as they will let me stand.

We have had season tickets for the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 50 yrs with unrivaled comparative satisfaction until we simultaneously started attending the NWS concerts over a decade ago. Both organizations have been commited to exploring new musical experiences with great success -i.e., up until this Pulse Concert. We fully understand the organizations mutual goal of reaching out to young listeners to preserve the future vitality of classical music, but encouraging loud noisy social interaction during a concert is the epitome of leadership stupidity. Having said that, if the audience for pulse had been meaningfully prohibited from talk in the concert hall per se (the Shhhh projected sign was initially very clever and well received but totally ineffectual)the potential positive experience for music lovers might well have been a success rather than a total disaster.

There aren't many artists/venues that mix classical and electronica music.\r\rWith that said - Pulse needs to clearly identify itself. It is either a nightclub atmosphere or a symphony, and since it is advertised as the prior then it should not display movements performed solely by the orchestra. This is not only based on my preferences, but rather by the way the show was described in the event info page and portrayed in the video on the NWS website. I believe if the audience NWS is targeting is a younger crowd then go all out and attract them. I do not believe a super loud, fast, and hard music sequence is necessary, but asking a crowd in a \"nightclub atmosphere\" to \"shh\" while the symphony is playing is not ideal. \r\rIf NWS wants to keep symphony-only movements then they should be maybe shortened a bit, or do not play pieces that that lulls, or soft portions, because you lose the attention of the crowd, which is difficult to regain.\r\rStanding above it was difficult to hear everything clearly. The mix of the voices, symphony, and dj made for an unpleasant auditory experience. I understand that the venue may be acoustically tuned, but most likely not for the addition of a talking crowd and electronica beats. One way I believe this can be remedied is either with louder speakers, or more of them. There simply was not enough wattage.\r\rIf done tastefully, I believe a stronger show would be well received by the audience. For those who came for a \"Pulse\" evening, they left wanting for more. The intermissions could have more pronounced electronica music accompanied with an instrument that is better heard, maybe like a solo violinist. The orchestra and dj should have a stronger relationship - for reference, see Metallica with San Francisco Symphony Orchestra videos on Youtube.\r\rI believe Pulse can cultivate itself into a destination show with a little tweaking. \r\r-Daniel Casey, dncasey.usa@hotmail.com","tags":[]}

The venue should not be afraid of displaying for visually exciting images on the wall. I understand that strobe lighting or lasers into the crowd may not be appealing to all, plus this is was not an actual club, but slow moving patterns were not effective. I enjoyed the green and blue hues, they were appealing. Also, the venue should make the room darker, maybe this can be accomplished by more focused images on the wall above and to the sides instead of a big splash screen; this will make it more intimate and draw more attention to the focused lighting upon the dj/symphony.

Choice of symphonic music at the end (more modern pieces) fit well, much better than the earlier pieces (and I love Stravinski, but) - would've liked more interaction with Bates and the Orchestra - the intros and outros with the Orchestra were amazing and blended seamlessly.   The interaction of live musicians (bass, 2 x trumpet) bring an aliveness to house music that is beyond what you can find in a club - and should be exploited as a differentiating aspect of the evening.  \r\rWe also loved the opportunity to listen and watch from different places, to mill about and dance.  That was a rather extrordinary part of the evening - especially for my 16 year old son.\r\rThe experience was warm, inviting and participatory - not merely observational.

I believe that the goal of fusing classical with electronic was achieved quite successfully from a musical perspective.  However, I believe that much work needs to be done in the balancing of the sound dynamically.  The electronic music was very well balanced and not excessively loud by Miami Beach club standards.  However, the classical music portion needs to be brought into balance with the tone and volume of the electronic music.  For example, when the DJ finished his portion and the instrumentalists came in, the background audience sound (having naturally risen to a level dictated by what the DJ was playing)drowned out most of the music.  This was sadly quite prominent during the Bartok quartets, where inspite of sitting right on top of the quartet, I could barely hear any music.  Due to the inherent nature of the woodwinds, they carried but a little better but still not in balance with what the DJ had played.","tags":[]}

I understand the event is new, but the concept is so unique - try to capture the audience and invigorate the guests to keep them there. The light effects and visuals were so amazing, yet they were hardly utilized, which made it all very underwhelming. Have an emcee or DJ who explains the event and what will take place, encourages guests not to leave because a \"grand finale\" a waits, and to boost the energy levels in the venue. The overall event had a series of highs (not very high) and lows (often times the beat was too mellow and the sounds were too soothing - I could have fallen asleep).  In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \u00ecPUMP IT UP!\u00ee to gain more  buzz and word of mouth (before you lose your audience).","tags":[]}

I especially enjoyed watching the mixed audience react favorably to this experiment.  Here are a couple notes I took away from the event that I believe may serve to improve it moving forward:\r\r1.   The dynamic range of the lighting should match that of the audible dynamic range of a symphonic performance.  The new building holds so much potential for dramatic effect simply by variating the level and source / location of lighting.  I suggest reducing the overall amount of ambient lighting within the performance space by the use of deeper color tones and less overhead sources.  This will increase the effect of focused beam lighting directed on the orchestra.\r\r2.  Classical instruments are absolutely amazing.  If this event is to christen non-symphonic goes to the beauty of the symphony, then I suggest more solo performances built into the Pulse format.  While the moving audience format may be somewhat of a challenge to audibility, I believe it might be overcome through the use of high frequency range sound sweeps just before the solo... this usually serves to sever conversation and quiet the space for a short interval so that attention may be focused on the soloist.\r\r3.  SET No. 4 seemed to be enjoyed the most by friends and acquaintances in attendance.  Set No. 3 was a close runner-up.  In post-event conversation, it seems to me the aspects people enjoyed most with regard to set 4, was that there was more interaction between the Mason & the orchestra.  Similarly, the aspects most enjoyed in Set No. 3 was the interaction between the conductor and the individual orchestra performers.  It created theater.\r\r4.  I have never before had the opportunity to walk around and behind the performers in mid-performance.  This was a real treat for me, both acoustically, and visually.

I only saw about four people dancing. But what can you do. Overall I like the PULSE ambience to enjoy classical music in place of the tradition temple-of-of the arts European heritage. Dislocations produce novel experiences. The DJ's program could have been more exciting in my opinion, was a little flat. I would have appreciated a little more rhythmic intensity.

The dance party at the end was a let down -- the electronic music was then mixed in with some oldies (Michael Jackson) and it just didn't seem coherent.  The end was anti-climactic.

Light show should be all over like in the past, not just on the screens.

While I thought the classical music in this one was excellent, I liked it better when the dj and the symphony played off each other not alternating sets.  Also, during the concert we were told to shush many times.  In fact my friend ordering a drink was told to be quiet when she was trying to pay.  Before it had more of a club feel.  Now it just feels like I'm standing during a symphony concert that plays DJ sets during the break.  I would not encourage people to attend this revised format.","tags":["music","morose"]}
,{"id":"515081e7bd11ff10b700002e","question":178,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"High (6 or more)","value":"Brilliant concept -- still not satisfactorily realized. Excellent program choices for the classical portions. Appropriately rhythmic and dissonant and loud - Shostakovich, Adams, Reich. Important to choose the styles appropriate for an event of this concept. DJ improved -- but  still not exciting. If you're going to mix genres, why not something exciting in all three (including jazz-like improvisations). The DJ portions seem like filler, with no intrinsic interest. How about some real jazz musicians to do the improvising? This is what I mean when I say that the concept is brilliant but still not effectively realized.","tags":[]}
