The set up allowed for a more personal interaction with the audience & players.  Almost felt like parlor music in a way as people mingled & socialized as the performers played on. \rAt times I did feel that the loudness of the crowed detracted from the experience of the musical performance.\rI am not particularly a techno fan, but this portrayed a nice bridge between the classical world & electronica.\rI will definitely attend a future performance & bring others who may have more of a techno appreciation & lack appreciation of classical music as I feel all can gain some appreciation of what was being cultivated & delivered to the audience that attended."},

I did find I had difficulty hearing at many times\u00d6and that was frustrating. I did not expect total silence but a little less club feel during performances would have been nice."},
{"id":"50463c1ebd11ff073c001e9a","question":174,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"45 to 64","value":"The only negative feedback I have is that, though I really like the social atmosphere there were several pieces - for example the Ades pieces that were really surprizingly good that I had never heard before. During this performance and quite a few others\u00d6the talking was so loud that you could barely hear the musicians. I do think that, as a professional musician myself, I like it when I get atleast a little bit of constructive acknowledgement from an audience. It lets me know they are participating and engaged. For this reason I think that there should be video prompts - likely dynamically displayed when the audience gets too loud\u00d6requestion more quite. Also, Benjamin seems very frustrated with the level of audience noise but did not say anything. I think he shoudl definately request that people tone it down during the less media driven/ambient parts of the performances. He actually thanked us when we (me especially,,,) let out a big SHHHHH\u00d6I think that he shoudl instruct the audience about what their decorum would ideally desired to be and I think that intro video media should also. Other than this the musicians were excellent, the music was very interesting and the mixd metaphores moving between the amient and electronica to symphonic moments were especially intruiging and I thought well done. Again the only negative that I found was that I could not appreciat them enough because I had difficulty hearing at many times."},

I would have like to hear more mixes between the DJ and the orchestra. The DJ sessions were too large compared to the time the orchestra was given to play. The conductor and orchestra were excellent!!! When the orchestra played it was very hard to hear because there were a lost of people talking (this is unavoidable)\rSuggestion: Why do not offer in another session the same concert without the DJ? Your wifi signal was very weak. In spite of these comments, this is one of the best Concert Halls in the USA"},

Might  have stayed longer had there been seats (we were four and stood throughout). Plus there was no red wine and white wine was served in a REALLY TINY inappropriate glass. Left and went to dinner elsewhere.\rBut If there is no red wine because of the staining....well I can live without it now that I think about it.  But just tell people that."},

We actually went to theater down at the UpClose Theater in the Arsht and from there to Pulse and from there back to the mainland for red wine and a late dinner.\rLast year much of the crowd really could have cared less about the music and it was painful being there with them.  I loved it when the room got totally silent to actually listen to the conductor.  It is working, I think. \rAs was it my imagination or not, but was not this year's crowd a bit older?  Not old old, but older? Particularly those who took all the seats before I got there!\rHad it been much more crowded we would likely have left much sooner.

Eventually, we figured it out but the front door staff was a bit confused.   Also, drink prices were a bit much---I know we are in South Beach but still feels like being pickpocketed.

I think the music selection of the symphony should have complemented the DJ's spinning session a little better. I enjoyed the freestyle trumpet along with the DJ.

The setting was beautiful. We were very impressed with the young conductor.  The only thing is people  kept talking while the musicians were playing so it's hard to enjoy the music with the background noise but I supposed that's part of the program when you have a setting like this.

In fact. the first orchestral selection, the opera, was quite boring, as was the DJ's music.  The latter was extraordinarily repetitive, much like you would expect to hear in a second rate club.  While the projections were enjoyable and enhanced the music to some extent, they were truly boring, particularly in comparison to last year's that were related thematically to the music.  The orchestra was splendid, particularly in the final selection and in the small string group performance.  In short, while enjoyable and unique, last night's program was disappointing."},

It is so refreshing to see so many young people clamoring to get in.  It offers a totally new and compelling format for classical concerts that, for all practical purposes, hasn't changed since the 17th century.  Every major orchestra should consider doing something like this because I'm convinced that it would generate a whole new audience.  However, it's important to present something that goes  beyond the mundane of what they experience in the clubs, that raises the bar of the musical experience, and last night's program did not do that.  Instead it seemed to pander to typical club goers without taking them to a new level.  The Pulse performance last April did that; last night's did not. "},

I was however, disappointed with the type of electronic music played.  It sounded very muddled and lacked any vocals or emotion.I would have liked to hear a slow build up followed by an intense break down.

Even though the instruments were amplified, there was a constant din of crowd chatter that could still be clearly heard even while the entire symphony was playing. These guys and gals deserve attention and are not simply background music for conversation. Maybe NWS could project a message on the walls asking for \"quiet moments\" when the entire symphony is playing. Chattering could resume during the electronic music and maybe even soloist songs. Easy to say, but probably difficult to achieve in reality. No fuddy duddy here. These comments are from a dedicated rock & roller who spends pleanty of time being blasted by classic rock, as close to the front of the stage as they will let me stand.

Both organizations have been commited to exploring new musical experiences with great success -i.e., up until this Pulse Concert. We fully understand the organizations mutual goal of reaching out to young listeners to preserve the future vitality of classical music, but encouraging loud noisy social interaction during a concert is the epitome of leadership stupidity. Having said that, if the audience for pulse had been meaningfully prohibited from talk in the concert hall per se (the Shhhh projected sign was initially very clever and well received but totally ineffectual)the potential positive experience for music lovers might well have been a success rather than a total disaster.

People that took seats treated it as  a reserved seat and would not relinquish it even if they left to walk around.  Standing for 3 hours was not the plan.  I was told upon calling the box office that there would be seating if one was tired of standing  & dancing (which there was none) but this was wrong information.

I understand the club feel and the socializing during the DJ sets but beyond that, it was very irritating. \rAlso, the staff wasn't paying attention when the people who didn't have a seat were standing in the aisles blocking the view for us folks sitting down. That was because the staff monitoring our section was down on the railing of the mezzanine watching the show instead of monitoring the crowd.\rWhat really killed me was that a Security Guard was standing by the door when we got up to leave, and saw the whole incident and didn't do anything about it either."},

{"id":"50463c1ebd11ff073c001e65","question":178,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"Under 45","value":"I was impressed with the concept. There aren't many artists/venues that mix classical and electronica music.\r\rWith that said - Pulse needs to clearly identify itself. It is either a nightclub atmosphere or a symphony, and since it is advertised as the prior then it should not display movements performed solely by the orchestra. This is not only based on my preferences, but rather by the way the show was described in the event info page and portrayed in the video on the NWS website. I believe if the audience NWS is targeting is a younger crowd then go all out and attract them. I do not believe a super loud, fast, and hard music sequence is necessary, but asking a crowd in a \"nightclub atmosphere\" to \"shh\" while the symphony is playing is not ideal. \r\rIf NWS wants to keep symphony-only movements then they should be maybe shortened a bit, or do not play pieces that that lulls, or soft portions, because you lose the attention of the crowd, which is difficult to regain.\r\rStanding above it was difficult to hear everything clearly. The mix of the voices, symphony, and dj made for an unpleasant auditory experience. I understand that the venue may be acoustically tuned, but most likely not for the addition of a talking crowd and electronica beats. One way I believe this can be remedied is either with louder speakers, or more of them. There simply was not enough wattage.\r\rIf done tastefully, I believe a stronger show would be well received by the audience. For those who came for a \"Pulse\" evening, they left wanting for more. The intermissions could have more pronounced electronica music accompanied with an instrument that is better heard, maybe like a solo violinist. The orchestra and dj should have a stronger relationship - for reference, see Metallica with San Francisco Symphony Orchestra videos on Youtube.\r\rI believe Pulse can cultivate itself into a destination show with a little tweaking. \r\r-Daniel Casey, dncasey.usa@hotmail.com"},

{"id":"50463c1ebd11ff073c001e65","question":174,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"Under 45","value":"The lighting was nice, but the projections on the wall were a bit dull. The venue should not be afraid of displaying for visually exciting images on the wall. I understand that strobe lighting or lasers into the crowd may not be appealing to all, plus this is was not an actual club, but slow moving patterns were not effective. I enjoyed the green and blue hues, they were appealing. Also, the venue should make the room darker, maybe this can be accomplished by more focused images on the wall above and to the sides instead of a big splash screen; this will make it more intimate and draw more attention to the focused lighting upon the dj/symphony.

That the ambiance created was very good - but as commented before, that when the DJ music was playing, the projections should have filled the place completely to avoid a feeling of semi-emptiness created by the lack of video material on two of the screens.\rEven though Mozart is perhaps our favorite composer, we felt that his music did not fit as well as the other selections played.  Perhaps too serene for the event.\r"},

{"id":"50463c1ebd11ff073c001e7d","question":174,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"65+","value":"We felt very strongly that when the classical music stopped (with its video presentation (which was very good), the other video work filling the rest of the screens should also have been projected onto the screens that during the live concert were occupied with the artistic production that matched the music.  When the NWS players ended (and so did the video that matched their playing), it felt like a vacuum on that side, as if the show had ended, or something was henceforth missing, until the next piece that was played live.  We think it was a mistake to do it this way, for it took away from the vitality of the scene when the NWS players were not on.\rAgain, we felt that the video material that was being projected on the other screens should have been extended to the remaining spaces."},

Choice of symphonic music at the end (more modern pieces) fit well, much better than the earlier pieces (and I love Stravinski, but) - would've liked more interaction with Bates and the Orchestra - the intros and outros with the Orchestra were amazing and blended seamlessly.   The interaction of live musicians (bass, 2 x trumpet) bring an aliveness to house music that is beyond what you can find in a club - and should be exploited as a differentiating aspect of the evening.  \r\rWe also loved the opportunity to listen and watch from different places, to mill about and dance.  That was a rather extrordinary part of the evening - especially for my 16 year old son.\r\rThe experience was warm, inviting and participatory - not merely observational.  I would think that such events would bring a great awakening to symphonic music."},

Bartok string Quartets don't work when you have several hundred people talking and drinking. Zappa program was killer. Give me more contemporary composers in this format. If you repeat the string quartet type of ensembles in this format, at least crank up the volume. Make it loud!!!! I love what you are trying to accomplish.

However, alternating between instuments and DJ made the event seem choppy and a bit boring. The final number when the complete ochestra and DJ were playing together was great. That is what I had expected for the entire event. The music was upbeat and you were able to appreciate the pairing of both musical syles in a cool and hit atmosphere.  Also, there should have been more high chair seating around the orchestra.If you wanteed to be close to the action, it ws uncomfortable to stand around for so much time.

I'm not sure I'll go to anymore pulse (unless taking someone to introduce them to you), but I will certainly go to concerts.  I love them and think you will probably make your website easier to use by next year.  Thanks!"},

I'd give an \"A\" for effort, but only a \"B-minus\" for execution. \r\rThe biggest problem: DOWN TIME. There was too much time between sets, leaving people milling about, waiting for something to happen. As a result, you lost momentum.\r\rYoung folks all have A.D.D. They need something to keep them entertained at every moment. The music needs to be LIVELY.\r\rThe whole thing was just getting good about the time I left, but the friend I was with had gotten bored with all the waiting, so wasn't willing to stick around any longer. Too bad for me. I was actually very moved watching the conductor, who was obviously loving what he does.\r\rIf I had it to do over again, I'd arrive later in the evening. Maybe you could shorten the evening, and pack more into a smaller space of time.\r\rI hope you take this in the spirit of constructive criticism. I love what you're trying to do. I think you just need to tweak it a bit. \r\rI would go to PULSE again!"},

I believe that the goal of fusing classical with electronic was achieved quite successfully from a musical perspective.  However, I believe that much work needs to be done in the balancing of the sound dynamically.  The electronic music was very well balanced and not excessively loud by Miami Beach club standards.  However, the classical music portion needs to be brought into balance with the tone and volume of the electronic music.  For example, when the DJ finished his portion and the instrumentalists came in, the background audience sound (having naturally risen to a level dictated by what the DJ was playing)drowned out most of the music.  This was sadly quite prominent during the Bartok quartets, where inspite of sitting right on top of the quartet, I could barely hear any music.  Due to the inherent nature of the woodwinds, they carried but a little better but still not in balance with what the DJ had played."},

I was close enough to the orchestra to be looking over a musician's shoulder at the notes on the music stand. The orchestra sound at that distance was quite thrilling, a unique experience far surpassing the normal concert experience. Unfortunately I could sustain this only briefly during the Bartok piece. I didn't know music could sound like that. \rPULSE is a fantastic idea because the average age of classical concertgoers seems to increase. If you're sixty, you feel young.

Quite a bit of the music was covered by the crowd noise. I guess you have to appreciate the event as a multimedia event with the music subordinated to the whole thing.  I only saw about four people dancing. But what can you do. Overall I like the PULSE ambience to enjoy classical music in place of the tradition temple-of-of the arts European heritage. Dislocations produce novel experiences. The DJ's program could have been more exciting in my opinion, was a little flat. I would have appreciated a little more rhythmic intensity. But he did a good job of seamlessly integrating his sets with the live music orchestral pieces. Let's do it again soon. "},

I guess it closed somewhere at the beginning of the performance. I did not realize there was a difference between electronic and Dance music. The dance type music did not really start until the symphony had finished for the entire evening. I would have liked more of the music you want to dance to earlier in the evening.  The conductor was very energetic and in this facility you can see the conductor from many angles. "},

However, I felt that it was executed below potential. I understand the demands it requires from the symphony / human beings, but the overall event needs to be more impactful, high-intensity, up-beat, and lively. Overall, the experience didn't live up to the expectations that I had because everything / everyone seemed to be underutilized. Often times you couldn't even tell a DJ was playing; the two final pieces were the best ones, and they saved it until the end of the night. If it weren't for my friends who encouraged me to stay, I would have left the event very early on. I understand the event is new, but the concept is so unique - try to capture the audience and invigorate the guests to keep them there. The light effects and visuals were so amazing, yet they were hardly utilized, which made it all very underwhelming. Have an emcee or DJ who explains the event and what will take place, encourages guests not to leave because a \"grand finale\" a waits, and to boost the energy levels in the venue. The overall event had a series of highs (not very high) and lows (often times the beat was too mellow and the sounds were too soothing - I could have fallen asleep).  In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \u00ecPUMP IT UP!\u00ee to gain more  buzz and word of mouth (before you lose your audience)."},

I was somewhat familiar with the work of Mason Bates prior to this event, but I really enjoyed the format of the whole evening.

Been able to walk around and stand next to a French Horn, a Clarinet or a Violin is something that concertgoers usually cannot do.

In a way I had different variations of the same concert, just depending were I was standing. And of course you get the full effect standing behind the Conductor, hearing what he hears, right there were the music is made!

Genres such as Currulao and Mapale have complex time signatures that would both inspire and challenge the NWS.  Note; these are more percussive genres that make use of hand made instruments such as the Marimba de Chonta.  Here is a link to a Currulao (lightly remixed) http://soundcloud.com/rktkt/a-la-cumbia-rktkts-cumbombita"},
{"id":"50463c1ebd11ff073c001f9e","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"Under 45","value":"I was significantly impressed by the NWS' display of forward thinking in their decision to experiment in this fashion.  I especially enjoyed watching the mixed audience react favorably to this experiment.  Here are a couple notes I took away from the event that I believe may serve to improve it moving forward:\r\r1.   The dynamic range of the lighting should match that of the audible dynamic range of a symphonic performance.  The new building holds so much potential for dramatic effect simply by variating the level and source / location of lighting.  I suggest reducing the overall amount of ambient lighting within the performance space by the use of deeper color tones and less overhead sources.  This will increase the effect of focused beam lighting directed on the orchestra.\r\r2.  Classical instruments are absolutely amazing.  If this event is to christen non-symphonic goes to the beauty of the symphony, then I suggest more solo performances built into the Pulse format.  While the moving audience format may be somewhat of a challenge to audibility, I believe it might be overcome through the use of high frequency range sound sweeps just before the solo... this usually serves to sever conversation and quiet the space for a short interval so that attention may be focused on the soloist.\r\r3.  SET No. 4 seemed to be enjoyed the most by friends and acquaintances in attendance.  Set No. 3 was a close runner-up.  In post-event conversation, it seems to me the aspects people enjoyed most with regard to set 4, was that there was more interaction between the Mason & the orchestra.  Similarly, the aspects most enjoyed in Set No. 3 was the interaction between the conductor and the individual orchestra performers.  It created theater.\r\r4.  I have never before had the opportunity to walk around and behind the performers in mid-performance.  This was a real treat for me, both acoustically, and visually.  Please don't change this!"},

I wish the pieces had been longer. Adding vocals or a strong percussion work in the future I'd really like to see. I wish the line outside moved with the same speed as you find at the movie theater. I wish the transitions from live to recorded music somehow could pause for audience applause, so the NWS musicians really know how awesome we think they are.

{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c002163","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"45 to 64","value":"The concert was too short. After all the great education about Stravinsky it would have been nice to hear a longer piece of his work. Teddy Abrams was excellent both in terms of conducting and his spoken information."},

Traffic and finding parking is really such a hassle in Miami Beach that patrons need a little bit of more time to get to the theater.  If the concert is at 8pm, it would be better."},

{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c002168","question":239,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"65+","value":"Narrative was somewhat geared toward a young audience;  phrases as 'cool', 'check it out', etc., were out of place with the overall informative presentation."},
{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c002168","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"65+","value":"Am enthused to attend as much as possible.  Every concert I've experienced in the hall and outdoors has been exceptional.  Video could become distracting to the music (especially animation with Pictures At An Exhibition) but viewing the orchestra in performance on the wall from the park is fabulous.  It surpasses Chicago's Millenium Park."},

{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c00216a","question":239,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"65+","value":"I thought that the video should have been shown while the Music was being played in some instances - like when the Elephants were dancing the video could have been playing when the Music was on."},
{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c00216a","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"65+","value":"My only concern was that the tickets do not have the cocktail time on them.  The first time I went a couple of years ago I missed the cocktails because I did not know about it and I came about 5 minutes before the concert started.  Now of course I know about it but it is still not mentioned on the tickets."},

{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c00216b","question":239,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"65+","value":"Video projections were the weak part of the event. Too many superficial (decorative) effects, insufficient in content. Irrelevant screen-saver-like images during performance should have been eliminated"},
{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c00216b","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"65+","value":"Excellent idea. Should be continued and encouraged. In my - and obviously others - case, an occasion to be skipped, though."},

The format of last night's concert was great for me because it allowed you to learn something about Stravinsky not only through words and pictures but then through actual examples via the orchestra playing his music.

She was overenthusiastic to the point where you felt she was addressing kingergarten children.  The video had little to do with the music.  If you are presenting music that was written for ballet it makes alot more sense to show ballet rather than squiggly lines or photos of Stravinsky sitting with the choreographer.  "},

I did appreciate that the doors were kept closed until about 7:10 otherwise we would have likely chosen a seat even earlier and completely missed the happy hour."},

{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c00218d","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"45 to 64","value":"I love this format, in general.  It really helps to have some background and info on the composer and the pieces to be played.  the video aspects are very interesting as well.  \rthis is a fun way to enjoy music and learn.  the length of the concert (less than 90 minutes) allows for dinner afterwards at not such a late hour."},

{"id":"50463c20bd11ff073c00218e","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Encounters","series_2":"Under 45","value":"I think the format is genius and now you just have to target the right audience for the modern approach which would be an audience half the age of who attended. I could help with this. The space, format, fellows were amazing and I think the young ICE (intellectual cultural entertainment) folks in Miami would love the  Splash approach if only they knew about it. We must get them in, for last night was a missed opportunity to educate young professionals, influencers and future leaders on the beauty, complexity, history and power of classical music. "},

{"id":"50fa46d6bd11ff51db000001","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"45 to 64","value":"I was very disappointed that the audience was so incredibly rude and noisy during the NWS performances. People should NOT be in the concert hall if all they want to do is talk (especially very LOUDLY) and use phones. Can't they go outside or into the lobby? Its mot fair to people who like myself came to listen tot he music."},

I could not be critical of what has been so far a successful experiment.  I believe that Pulse and the Wallcasts have been successful in attracting an audience who would have not in the past been enthusiastic about classical music. I also believe that the choice of programs played successfully bridges the classical and the contemporary tastes.."},

Maybe the music can be happier and there is opportunity for the dj to use some rithyms already known and popular, that way the fusion would have been more powerful. Some classical known from Bethoven and then an electronic known by the youngers, maybe inspired on famous djs like Guetta. But overall... Great great show!!! "},

It is incredibly unique and I know of few events like it anywhere in the world.  Love the fusion of so many beautiful elements in an edgy environment which at the same time is open, free, fun and where you can get so close to the music and the musicians.  It really is great.  This Pulse, while good, did not live up to my expectations of what Pulse should be about based on former Pulses. "},

It didn't feel like a collaboration between the DJ and the orchestra, which would have been more interesting. Some of the classical pieces like the tango were wonderful, but the rest were kind of flat.  Also, will call was a disaster.  Next time,  offer the option to print tickets at home at the time of purchase.  It's the smart \"modern\" thing to do.  Everybody does it."},

I also thought about the evolution of the concert hall; when did attending a classical concert become so stiff? Is what I just experienced similar to what court music was like centuries ago (minus the lights and electronica of course)? I found the whole experience to be such a refreshing way to enjoy classical music. I say this as a Juilliard trained musician. I think it is so awesome that people that have never experienced classical music and experienced concert-goers could equally enjoy this experience, while each taking away a new and different perspective on classical music."},

This time was a bit disappointing. Beyond the fact there were only 2 sets of classical music, I didn't enjoy the selections quite as much as the previous time I attended.

I didn't understand the experience/feeling that you were trying to elicit at all.  The experience seemed to even create more proximity between the two musical worlds instead of reducing them.

{"id":"50fd64e2bd11ffa50c000001","question":178,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"Under 45","value":"Disappointed.  I thought the classical music was drowned out by a lot of crowd chatter -- that really affected the experience. The classical music seemed to be well-done, but it was really hard to hear.  Also, I was disappointed to see the opera singer using a microphone.  I don't know if that had more to do with the acoustics of the space, but I think that detracted from the experience.  \r\n\r\nThe electronic dance music was just o.k.  The dance party at the end was a let down -- the electronic music was then mixed in with some oldies (Michael Jackson) and it just didn't seem coherent.  The end was anti-climactic.  I would have liked to go to UNPLUGGED in the pavillion, but there were poor directions about where that event was supposed to take place.  Maybe this was announced at some point, but it was really difficult to hear anything because of constant crowd-chatter."},
{"id":"50fd64e2bd11ffa50c000001","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"Under 45","value":"Crowd chatter, and audience appreciation/respect must be improved in order to create the best experience for everyone.  I was looking forward to really experiencing the classical music, and letting loose/dancing/chatting when appropriate during the electronic performance.  It just was not structured that way. It seemed like the primary focus was for everyone to hang out around some live music, but not to actually appreciate it, which I feel is unfortunate."},
{"id":"50fd64e2bd11ffa50c000001","question":174,"series_1":"NWS: PULSE","series_2":"Under 45","value":"The video projections and lighting were definitely some of the best parts of the performance.  However, the video projections did NOT work when they only reflected the musicians playing.  It was best when it depicted some other visual interpretation of the music.  That visual interpretation could be further enhanced."},

Choices for classical program excellent, and well matched to the overall event concept (Piazzola, Daugherty, Ginastera). The Pulse concept is very exciting, but still hasn't been realized to full potential. The light show and imagery was much improved in quality, I thought, compared to earlier version. The electronic tracks and the solo improvisations still lack variety and rhythmic excitement. The club atmosphere aimed at demands that the rhythms COMPEL people to dance.\r\nAND too many people came to catch up with old friends and after the first set displayed a complete indifference to the music. You recognized this problem in your pleas for silent attention. About that portion of the audience you could ask yourself, Do they belong here, or wouldn't just any old bar do?"},

Several years ago you held a concert whose tittle had \"Fiesta\" in it. A brilliant female Mexican conductor was \r\nfeatured and it was a hit in the community and the vibrant hispanic art world in Miami.\r\nThe concert was sold out, nothing similar has been featured since.\r\nPlease note that the Latin American community is vital to Miami's economy and cultural landscape.

Obviously the interpolated movements where there for the audience member to draw comparisons.  The rationale behind the choices was, nfortunately, not addressed. The title also suggest a chronology.

I wish more conductors wound make comment regarding the music. Several venues perform the pre-concert discussions i.e Berkshire Choral Festival, some of Tanglewood-BSO concerts use this format. I think this onformational format takes the stuffiness that keeps some people away from the concert hall. We have to interest the young people in the genre.

Nevertheless, the selections, organization, performances and program notes combined to make a spectacular event.

{"id":"5123bc95bd11ff62df0000a8","question":182,"series_1":"NWS: Journey","series_2":"45 to 64","value":"I enjoy the format. However a few quibbles\r\n--Choice of works not optimal. I understand picking some more obscure pieces to complement the warhorses, but to have the  Rondo in D as the representative of piano and orchestra was a poor choice. Mozart's piano concertos are perhaps the greatest contribution to the genre in music, and a movement from one of his great ones (there are lots) would have been much better.\r\n--It's nice and quite convenient to have chamber players set up to begin once the orchestra stops between movements. However in both this and the Beethoven journey, the string quartet is poorly served by the acoustics (I was sitting in the 5th row of Gallery 4). If there is a way to have them set up on the sides of the stage it might sound better.\r\nThanks for asking! I love NWS"},

However, I was disappointed in the tone of the piano forte.  I've heard other period instruments that sounded better and projected better with an orchestra.

Excellent program choices for the classical portions. Appropriately rhythmic and dissonant and loud - Shostakovich, Adams, Reich. Important to choose the styles appropriate for an event of this concept. DJ improved -- but  still not exciting. If you're going to mix genres, why not something exciting in all three (including jazz-like improvisations). The DJ portions seem like filler, with no intrinsic interest. How about some real jazz musicians to do the improvising? This is what I mean when I say that the concept is brilliant but still not effectively realized."},

Light show should be all over like in the past, not just on the screens.

Also, during the concert we were told to shush many times.  In fact my friend ordering a drink was told to be quiet when she was trying to pay.  Before it had more of a club feel.
